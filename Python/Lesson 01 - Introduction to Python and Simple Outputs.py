# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python and Simple Outputs

# This lesson introduces basic Python syntax and simple print statements.

# Code Segment for the Lesson:

# Example 1: Simple print statements
print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
print("My first Python program.")

# Example 2: Multiple print statements
print("Python is fun!")
print("Let's learn together!")

# Example 3: Print with escape characters
print("Hello,\nWorld!")  # \n creates a new line
print("She said, \"Python is amazing!\"")

# Example 4: Combining text and numbers
print("The year is", 2024)


# Questions Section:
# 1. What will be the output of the two print statements in Example 1?
# 2. How many lines will the output of Example 2 take?
# 3. What does the \n character do in Example 3?
# 4. Why do we use backslashes before double quotes in Example 3?
# 5. Can you combine text and numbers in a single print statement as shown in Example 4?



# Answers Section:
# 1. The output will be:
#    Welcome to Python Programming!
#    My first Python program.
# 2. The output will take two lines:
#    Python is fun!
#    Let's learn together!
# 3. The \n character inserts a new line, so the output will be:
#    Hello,
#    World!
# 4. Backslashes are used to escape special characters. In this case, it allows us to include double quotes within a string.
# 5. Yes, you can combine text and numbers in a single print statement by separating them with commas.
