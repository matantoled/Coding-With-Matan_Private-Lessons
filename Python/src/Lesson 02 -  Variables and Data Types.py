# Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

# This lesson introduces variables, basic data types, and simple arithmetic operations.

# Code Segment for the Lesson:

# Example 1: Storing text in variables
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

# Example 2: Working with numbers
age = 16
print("You are", age, "years old.")

# Example 3: Simple calculations
length = 5
width = 3
area = length * width
print("The area of the rectangle is", area)

# Example 4: Changing variable values
counter = 0
counter = counter + 1
print("Counter is now:", counter)



# Questions Section:
# 1. What will the output be when the code in Example 1 is executed?
# 2. What data type is the variable 'age' in Example 2?
# 3. What is the value of 'area' in Example 3 and why?
# 4. What will be the value of 'counter' after the code in Example 4 is executed?

# Answers Section:
# 1. The output will be:
#    Hello, Alice!
# 2. The data type of the variable 'age' is an integer (int).
# 3. The value of 'area' will be 15 because it is the product of 'length' (5) and 'width' (3).
# 4. The value of 'counter' will be 1 after the code is executed.
